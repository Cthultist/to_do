The goal is to make at least a terminal based to-do list. 

It needs to accept use input

it needs to be able to store data

it needs to be able to format output text

it needs to be able to gracefully fail when non ut8 characters are used.

it needs to be possibly visually interesting in how it uses the text forms-- possibly some sort of table.

it needs a way to exit

it needs a possibly ascii title. the title itself isn't more than to_do

a task in the t-do list could have:
-a description
a state which indicates progress (not started, in progress, completed)

input tasks into a vector?

use hashmaps to include categories to task items.
